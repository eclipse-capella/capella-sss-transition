== System Model (Source) ==

By default, Capella elements don't have any SID. As soon as a transition is performed, 

* If the SID of the source element is null, it is initialized with the technical ID of the source element
* If the SID of the source element is not null (i.e. the system is already a sub system, result of a transition), the SID is kept.

In the above figure, the ''LogicalComponent1'' ID is equal to its SID. 

== Sub-System Model ==

The target element gets a new technical ID, its SID is the one of the source element in the System model.

In the above figure, the ''LogicalComponent 1'' (which is the System element of targetModel) SID is equal to the SID of the ''LogicalCompenent 1'' of sourceModel (System Model).

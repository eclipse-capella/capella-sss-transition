== TRANSFORMATION COMMAND ==
 
Transitions are possible from one or several logical, physical components or one Configuration Item. The Multiphase Transition is only available from one or more selected node physical components.

# Open the source Melody Advance project model
# Select one or several components (in the Project Explorer or in a diagram).
# From the contextual menu (right click), select "System To SubSystem Transition" and then, the kind of Transition to be performed.

== Configuration of the transition ==
 
A configuration dialog opens and allows, among others, to choose the target model.

== Gap analysis with previous iteration of the transition ==
 
Once the target project selected, a Diff/Merge dialog displays the the differences between the transformation result shown in the center and the target model shown on the right.
 
It is now possible to either selectively merge changes, or to merge all planned changes by pressing the "Apply" button.

Further information about the Diff/Merge tool can also be found in the [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.diffmerge.doc/html/21.%20Model%20DiffMerge/21.1.%20Model%20DiffMerge.html?cp=5_0_8_2#Configuration_and_Features_of_the_Diff.2FMerge_Tool|Diff/Merge documentation]]

 
== Transition Log ==

Once the transition performed, the Information view contains the listing of the actions performed. By right clicking on an action, the source and target object can be accessed:

== Validation Rules ==

The vertical transformation SA-LA-PA includes 4 validation rules that warn the user about inconsistent element allocations and deployments on target models. In general, these rules inspect the pre-allocation links generated by the multiphase transformation and crosscheck existing allocations and deployments against these pre-allocation links. A pre-allocation link is a kind of trace and thus filtered from the Capella Explorer by default. Each rule verifies a specific kind of allocation/deployment:

'''HW_01 - Logical Function Allocations'''

Checks if a Logical Function is allocated on the expected Logical Component.

'''HW_02 - Physical Component Deployment'''

Checks if a Behavioral Physical Component is deployed in the expected Node Physical Component.

'''HW_03 - Logical Functional Exchange Allocations'''

Checks if a Logical Functional Exchange is allocated on the expected Component Exchange.

'''HW_04 - Physical Component Exchange Allocations'''

Checks if a Physical Component Exchange is allocated on the expected Physical Link.

The validation rules can be enabled/disabled selectively by selecting Window->Preferences->Model Validation->Constraints. The multiphase transition rules can then be found under Capella->Subsystem Transition Addon:

To launch a validation, select a suitable model element (e.g. SystemEngineering) and choose ''Validate Model'' from its context menu.

			<b>System to Sub System transition</b> add-on enables automated and iterative transition between system and subsystems.

		<p>
			<b>System to Sub System transitions are top-down and iterative:</b> any change performed in the original System can be propagated at any moment to the Sub System.
		</p>
		<p>Traceability between System and Sub System is ensured through a 
			<b>mechanism based on system-wide ID&rsquo;s</b>.

		<h2 id="Scoped_Horizontal_Extraction">Scoped Horizontal Extraction</h2>
		<p>The objective of this transition is to extract a subset of the Physical or Logical Architecture and populate a new model with this subset.</p>

		</p>
		<p>The transformation algorithm performs the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be extracted starting from one or several Physical / Logical Components</li>
			<li>Comparison with previous extraction</li>
			<li>Merge</li>
		</ol>

			<b>Recommandations</b>
		</p>
		<p>Mixing both Node and Behavior PCs is not recommended.</p>
		<p>However if you do so, deploying nodes and merging rules will be applied for all deployed Behavioral PCs</p>
		<h2 id="Vertical_Transition_.28SA.29">Vertical Transition (SA)</h2>
		<p>The objective of this transition is to re-apply the methodology starting from one or several given Configuration Item(s). </p>

		<p>The transformation algorithm performs the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Computation of the transitive closure of elements to be transformed or copied starting from one or several Configuration Items</li>
			<li>Transformation of elements (for example, a sibling Physical Component will become a System Actor)</li>
			<li>Comparison with previous transition</li>
			<li>Merge</li>

		<h2 id="Vertical_Transition_.28SA-LA-PA.29">Vertical Transition (SA-LA-PA)</h2>
		<p>The principle of the transition is to select one or more Node Physical Component from a source model and generate (or update) a target model whose system of interest will be the selection.</p>
		<p>The transition will automatically create the target model and fill its three phases (System Analysis, Logical Architecture and Physical Architecture) with new Capella objects linked to the objects of the source model:</p>
